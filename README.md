Drill Through Like a Boss: Advanced Techniques to Elevate Your Reports with Brian Julius

Drillthrough is a great way to provide autonomy to the viewer - allowing them to choose the level of detail they want to see, while keeping your main report clean and uncluttered. 

This presentation will demonstrate some of my favorite techniques for expanding the typical uses of drillthrough, and making the technique more intuitive to the viewer, including: 
Improved drillthrough via tooltips 
Drillthrough on images 
Creation of dedicated multi-state drillthrough buttons 
Creation of dynamic drillthrough button text 
DAX-controlled conditional drillthrough 
Conditional formatting driven by drillthrough selection 
Advanced drillthrough on spatial data.
